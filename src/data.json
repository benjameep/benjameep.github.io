So, I learned D3, poured over a bunch of scholarly articles on how to generate visualizations of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). After 10 different attempts and almost declaring it impossible three times (never out loud), something started to form. This project still has a lot of refining to go but is on track to become accepted by the university and used by the entire school.",

It is now used by our entire team and has 12-50 downloads per week on npm.",

So I created a Single Page Application that completely client-side (our team doesn't have a server) Oauth's with Github, retrieves data from <a href=\"toggl.com\">Toggl's API</a>, updates firebase, and displays with d3 when a project is worked on, the bandwidth it is taking of the team, and history of the project. This project has been put on hold for now but will be picked back up and implemented soon.",

So I scraped the public student directory (no easy task) and sent their home town to one of Googleâ€™s apis to look up the latitude and longitude of each. Instead of the traditional grouping where two nodes near each other form a single larger node. I used d3-simulation to give each node collision and gravity towards where they are supposed to be. This resulted in high-density cities near each other to get squished, and I had to cache to locations of each node because it takes so long for the simulation to run. So If I were to do this project again, I would probably go the other route.",

The algorithm to generate these mazes took the good portion of a summer to figure out, and of course actually programming it always brings its own challenges. The easy part was creating the actual game. As it turns out humans are really bad at this type of maze, because the correct way to go is often not in the direction of the target. So, it results in just moving around randomly until you hit the target. Cool algorithm, bad game.",
